## :pencil2: Overview

**My Sports Club Manager** is a web application for managing sports, clubs, contests and trainings. The application combines a lot of functionality which can be useful for all types of users. If you are a trainer, you can easily administer your club, training sessions and students. If you are an athlete and wondering where to begin your journey, this app can offer you a variety of opportunities. You can very simply join a club and enroll in their trainings. Also, if you are good enough, you can sign up for contests. The site provides functionality for athletes to communicate with coaches via emails and to write reviews for clubs. The reviews can be supervised by an administrator with the help of a trained ML model, which can predict the sentiment of a given text. The main idea of the application is to make the management of sports clubs more accessible and functional.
